What is SQL?
SQL is the standard language for dealing with Relational Databases.
SQL keywords are NOT case sensitive: select is the same as SELECT

Semicolon after SQL Statements?
Semicolon is the standard way to separate each SQL statement in database systems that allow more than one SQL statement to be executed in the same call to the server.

Some of The Most Important SQL Commands
    SELECT - extracts data from a database
    UPDATE - updates data in a database
    DELETE - deletes data from a database
    INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database
    CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database
    ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database
    CREATE TABLE - creates a new table
    ALTER TABLE - modifies a table
    DROP TABLE - deletes a table
    CREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key)
    DROP INDEX - deletes an index

To create databases:
Create Database 1yz02 Without Check >>> CREATE DATABASE 1yz02;
Create Database 1yz02 If Its Not Exists >>> CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS 1yz02;
Delete Database 1yz02 Without Check >>> DROP DATABASE 1yz02;
Delete Database 1yz02 If Its Exists >>> DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS 1yz02;


The MySQL SELECT Statement
The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.
**SELECT Syntax**
SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name; 
Here, column1, column2, ... are the field names of the table you want to select data from. To select all the fields available in the table, use the following syntax:
SELECT * FROM table_name; 


The MySQL WHERE Clause:
The WHERE clause is used to filter records.
It is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition.
