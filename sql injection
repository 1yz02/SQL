What is SQL injection (SQLi)?
SQL injection (SQLi) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. This can allow an attacker to view data that they are not normally able to retrieve. 
This might include data that belongs to other users, or any other data that the application can access. In many cases,
an attacker can modify or delete this data, causing persistent changes to the application's content or behavior. 

How to detect SQL injection vulnerabilities
 You can detect SQL injection manually using a systematic set of tests against every entry point in the application. To do this, you would typically submit:
    The single quote character ' and look for errors or other anomalies.
    Some SQL-specific syntax that evaluates to the base (original) value of the entry point, and to a different value, and look for systematic differences in the application responses.
    Boolean conditions such as OR 1=1 and OR 1=2, and look for differences in the application's responses.
    Payloads designed to trigger time delays when executed within a SQL query, and look for differences in the time taken to respond. 

Retrieving hidden data
Imagine a shopping application that displays products in different categories. When the user clicks on the Gifts category, their browser requests the URL:"https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts"
This causes the application to make a SQL query to retrieve details of the relevant products from the database: SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1
 This SQL query asks the database to return:
    all details (*)
    from the products table
    where the category is Gifts
    and released is 1
The restriction released = 1 is being used to hide products that are not released. We could assume for unreleased products, released = 0

Subverting application logic:
Imagine an application that lets users log in with a username and password. If a user submits the username 1yz02 and the password 1111, 
  the application checks the credentials by performing the following SQL query:SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '1yz02' AND password = '1111'
In this case, an attacker can log in as any user without the need for a password. They can do this using the SQL comment sequence -- to remove the password check from the WHERE clause of the query.

For example, submitting the username administrator'-- and a blank password results in the following query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'--' AND password = ''
This query returns the user whose username is administrator

SQL injection UNION attacks
 When an application is vulnerable to SQL injection, and the results of the query are returned within the application's responses, you can use the UNION keyword to retrieve data from other tables within the database. This is commonly known as a SQL injection UNION attack.
The UNION keyword enables you to execute one or more additional SELECT queries and append the results to the original query. For example: SELECT a, b FROM table1 UNION SELECT c, d FROM table2
 To carry out a SQL injection UNION attack, make sure that your attack meets these two requirements. This normally involves finding out:
    How many columns are being returned from the original query.
    Which columns returned from the original query are of a suitable data type to hold the results from the injected query.
